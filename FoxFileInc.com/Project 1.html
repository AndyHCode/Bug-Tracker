<h2>Employee Data Organization System </h2>
<h5> 
<p>
A program ready for Forestview that utilizes Python to append new data to a CSV file. It also allows the user to search for any data within the CSV file and also provides the user the option to delete data from the CSV file. (See technical details for more information on how our program works) On top of this we allow administration to view a log of what changes have been made in the CSV file. Right now we are currently working on implementing an encryption service that protects the Clients data.
